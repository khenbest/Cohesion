# Cohesion Core Principles: Development Done Differently

## Welcome to AI Assisted Development _Without_ the Chaos

Cohesion isn't just another development tool - it's a philosophy that makes you AND your sessions with Claude Code more efficient by preventing problems instead of solving them.

## The Six Core Principles

### 🧠 [1. Think Before You Build](01-think-before-build.md)
**The Problem**: Jumping into code creates bugs that take hours to fix  
**The Solution**: 10 minutes of planning saves hours of debugging  
**What Changes**: Your AI assistant literally won't let you code until you've thought things through

### ✅ [2. The "Works Everywhere" Test](02-works-everywhere.md)
**The Problem**: "It works on my machine" wastes everyone's time  
**The Solution**: Test everything before claiming success  
**What Changes**: No more embarrassing "but it worked for me" moments

### 🕵️ [3. Reality Check Protocol](03-reality-check.md)
**The Problem**: Building on wrong assumptions creates cascading failures  
**The Solution**: When expected doesn't match actual, find out why  
**What Changes**: Mysterious bugs disappear when you investigate mismatches

### 📋 [4. Smart Approval Boundaries](04-approval-boundaries.md)
**The Problem**: Too many interruptions OR costly mistakes from too much freedom  
**The Solution**: Clear rules about what needs permission  
**What Changes**: Maximum speed within safe boundaries

### 📝 [5. Naming That Makes Sense](05-naming-that-works.md)
**The Problem**: Confusing names slow everyone down  
**The Solution**: Consistent, clear naming patterns  
**What Changes**: Code becomes self-documenting

### 🔗 [6. Close the Loop](06-close-the-loop.md)
**The Problem**: Major changes break things you forgot about  
**The Solution**: Analyze ripple effects before implementing  
**What Changes**: System-wide consistency maintained automatically

## How These Work Together

```
DISCOVER Mode (Exploration)
└── Think-First: Understand before acting
└── Reality-Check: Investigate all findings

OPTIMIZE Mode (Collaboration)  
└── Approval-Criteria: Get permission for changes
└── Works-Everywhere: Test before claiming

UNLEASH Mode (Execution)
└── Works-Everywhere: Continuous validation
└── Naming-Conventions: Maintain clarity
```

## Why This Matters To You

Traditional development:
- Write code → Find bugs → Debug → Rewrite → Debug more
- Time: 5-10 hours for a feature
- Frustration: High
- Rework: Constant

Cohesion methodology:
- Think → Plan → Build once → Works
- Time: 1-2 hours for same feature
- Frustration: Minimal
- Rework: Rare

## Real Examples

### Without Cohesion
```
You: "Add a search feature"
AI: *immediately writes search code*
Result: Doesn't handle edge cases, breaks with special characters
Debug time: 3 hours
```

### With Cohesion
```
You: "Add a search feature"
AI: "Let me first understand the data structure and requirements..."
Result: Handles all cases, works first time
Total time: 45 minutes
```

## Quick Start

1. **New to Cohesion?** Start with [Think Before You Build](01-think-before-build.md)
2. **Having bugs?** Read [Reality Check Protocol](03-reality-check.md)
3. **Working with others?** Check [Approval Boundaries](04-approval-boundaries.md)

**OR** 

Simply install Cohesion and let Cohesion Learn guide you through the basics. Access any time by running **cohesion learn** 

## The Bottom Line

These aren't just nice ideas - they're enforced by the system:
- Hooks prevent common mistakes
- Your AI assistant follows these principles
- The system guides you toward success

Every methodology exists for one reason: **to multiply your effectiveness by preventing problems before they happen.**
