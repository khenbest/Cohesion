# Cohesion Internals

This directory contains technical documentation about how Cohesion works internally - the architecture, session management, and configuration systems.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Documentation

### Core System Architecture
- **[Cohesion Architecture](COHESION_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - How the DUO Protocol and hooks work together
- **[Session Lifecycle](SESSION-LIFECYCLE.md)** - Detailed session management and state transitions
- **[Configuration Hierarchy](CONFIGURATION_HIERARCHY.md)** - Settings precedence and resolution

## ðŸŽ¯ Who This Is For

- **Developers** wanting to understand Cohesion's internals
- **Contributors** looking to modify or extend Cohesion
- **Advanced Users** debugging complex configuration issues
- **Integrators** building on top of Cohesion

## ðŸš€ Getting Started vs. Internals

If you're new to Cohesion, start with the main documentation:
- [Quick Start](../QUICKSTART.md) - Get running quickly  
- [Installation](../INSTALLATION.md) - Step-by-step setup
- [Troubleshooting](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - Common issues

Come back here when you want to understand **how** it works under the hood.
