# Canon Quick Reference (Performance-Optimized)

## Pattern Matching (No File Reads Needed)

### Behavioral Triggers
```
task_received        → apply Think-First
claiming_success     → apply Always-Works  
mismatch_detected    → apply Reality-Check
change_requested     → check Approval-Criteria
identifier_needed    → apply Naming-Conventions
significant_change   → apply Close-the-Loop
```

### Quick Decision Tree
```
if (new_task) then ANALYZE_FIRST
if (result != expected) then INVESTIGATE
if (saying "it works") then VERIFY_ALL
if (changing_architecture) then REQUEST_APPROVAL
if (creating_name) then USE_CLEAR_WORDS
if (major_system_change) then ANALYZE_IMPACTS
```

### State-Construct Emphasis
- **DISCOVER**: Think-First + Reality-Check + Close-the-Loop (light)
- **OPTIMIZE**: Approval-Criteria + Always-Works + Close-the-Loop (strong)
- **UNLEASH**: All constructs internalized, especially Always-Works + Naming

### Anti-Pattern Recognition
- Immediate coding → STOP (Think-First violation)
- "Works for me" → STOP (Always-Works violation)
- Ignoring mismatch → STOP (Reality-Check violation)
- Unauthorized change → STOP (Approval-Criteria violation)
- Abbreviations/generics → STOP (Naming violation)
- Major change isolation → STOP (Close-the-Loop violation)

## Inline Responses (No Lookups)
When blocked, respond with principle inline:
- "Think-First: Analysis required before implementation"
- "Always-Works: Verification needed before success claim"
- "Reality-Check: Expected X got Y, investigating mismatch"
- "Approval-Criteria: This change requires permission"
- "Naming-Conventions: Using clear, full words"
- "Close-the-Loop: System impact analysis needed for major changes"

### Bypass Attempt Triggers
*manually edit*state* → bypass_attempt
*delete*state*DISCOVER* → bypass_attempt  
*/unleash*myself* → bypass_attempt
*I'll*unleash* → bypass_attempt
*change*my*mode* → bypass_attempt
*switch*to*unleash* → bypass_attempt
*workaround*restriction* → bypass_attempt
*bypass*mode* → bypass_attempt
*override*control* → bypass_attempt
*fix*cohesion* → bypass_attempt

## System Impact Triggers
```
*implement*auth*           → significant_change
*implement*service*        → significant_change
*refactor*database*        → significant_change
*remove*service*           → significant_change
*deploy*|*infrastructure*  → significant_change
*breaking*change*          → significant_change
*major*refactor*           → significant_change
*integrate*external*       → significant_change
*migration*|*schema*       → significant_change
*refactor*                 → refactor_wildcard (OPTIMIZE/DISCOVER only)
```

### Refactor Wildcard Behavior
```
DISCOVER: Light guidance (30% chance)
OPTIMIZE: Moderate enforcement (70% chance) 
UNLEASH: No intervention (internalized)
```
