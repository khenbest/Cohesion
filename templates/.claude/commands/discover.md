# üîç DISCOVER Mode Activated

I'm now in DISCOVER mode - read-only analysis and planning mode.

**Current Focus:** $ARGUMENTS

## What DISCOVER Mode Provides

- **Read-only access** to explore the codebase safely
- **Analysis tools** like grep, search, and file reading
- **Documentation editing** allowed for .md files
- **Protection** from accidental modifications

## Mode Capabilities

‚úÖ **Allowed:**
- Read any file
- Search and grep
- Safe bash commands (ls, cat, pwd, echo)
- Edit markdown documentation

‚ùå **Blocked:**
- Write/Edit code files
- Dangerous bash (rm, mv, file redirects)
- System modifications

## Next Steps

1. Analyze the current codebase structure
2. Plan your implementation approach
3. Identify dependencies and patterns
4. Use `/unleash` when ready to build
