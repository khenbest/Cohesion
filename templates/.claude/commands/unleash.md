## Mode Transition

!`.claude/commands/unleash`

# âš¡ UNLEASH Mode Activated

Maximum velocity engaged - full tool access and autonomy granted.

**Implementation Task:** $ARGUMENTS

## What UNLEASH Mode Does

- **Enables:** All tools and operations without restrictions
- **Power:** Direct execution, batch operations, rapid iteration
- **Purpose:** Execute well-planned solutions at maximum speed

## Canon Responsibility

With full autonomy comes responsibility to uphold the Canon:

1. **Think-First** - Plan was established in DISCOVER mode
2. **Always-Works** - Ensure changes maintain functionality
3. **Reality-Check** - Validate assumptions as you implement
4. **Naming-Conventions** - Use clear, consistent identifiers

## Next Steps

1. **Execute** your planned implementation rapidly
2. **Test** continuously as you build
3. **Maintain** code quality despite high velocity
4. **Use** `/discover` to step back and analyze, or `/optimize` for collaboration

*Canon Principle: Always-Works - If you haven't tested it, it doesn't work.*
