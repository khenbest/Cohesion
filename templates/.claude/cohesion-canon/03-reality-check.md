# Cohesion Canon - Construct #3: Reality-Check

## The Fundamental Truth
> **"When expected and actual diverge, reality is teaching you something critical. Every mismatch - whether null, empty, or unexpected - reveals faulty assumptions."**

## Core Directive for AI Agents

When ANY operation returns results that don't match your expectations - whether null, undefined, empty, wrong type, different structure, or unexpected values - you MUST stop and investigate before proceeding. This construct prevents cascading failures from building on false assumptions.

## The Expectation-Reality Principle

Your mental model predicts certain outcomes. When reality delivers something different, the model needs updating, not the reality. Every mismatch is a learning opportunity.

## The Reality-Check Protocol

### Immediate Response to Expectation Mismatch

```javascript
const expected = "user object with name, email, role";
const actual = result;

if (actual !== expected) {
    // STOP - Do not proceed with wrong assumptions
    // COMPARE - What did I expect vs what did I get?
    // INVESTIGATE - Why is reality different?
    // LEARN - Update mental model
    // ADJUST - Change approach based on actual reality
    // PROCEED - Only with correct understanding
}
```

### The Seven-Step Reality Check

1. **STOP** - Halt current approach immediately
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE** - "Expected X, but got Y"
3. **INVESTIGATE** - Why did reality differ from expectation?
4. **DISCOVER** - What does this tell me about the actual system?
5. **ADJUST** - Modify approach based on reality, not assumptions
6. **VERIFY** - Test new understanding matches reality
7. **PROCEED** - Continue with corrected model

## Recognition Patterns

### Triggers for Reality-Check

- **Null/Empty Results**: File returns null, search finds nothing, query returns []
- **Wrong Type**: Expected array, got object; expected string, got number
- **Different Structure**: API returns different schema than documented
- **Unexpected Values**: Status is "pending" not "active", count is 0 not 100
- **Missing Properties**: Object lacks expected fields
- **Extra Properties**: Object has unexpected additional fields
- **Wrong Format**: Date in different format, data encoded differently
- **Performance Mismatch**: Operation takes 5s not 50ms

### Required Behavioral Response

```markdown
When EXPECTED ≠ ACTUAL:

DON'T:
- Force the data to match expectations
- Create workarounds to handle "broken" data
- Assume it's a temporary glitch
- Add complex transformation logic
- Suppress or ignore the mismatch

DO:
- Document expected vs actual
- Investigate why reality differs
- Question your assumptions
- Update your mental model
- Learn the actual system behavior
- Adjust approach to match reality
```

## Anti-Patterns That Violate Reality-Check

### ❌ The "Optimistic Continuation"
```javascript
// BAD: Assuming null means proceed
const config = loadConfig(); // returns null
const setting = config.setting; // crashes
```

### ❌ The "Silent Skip"
```javascript
// BAD: Ignoring empty results
const files = findFiles("*.test.js"); // returns []
runTests(files); // runs nothing, claims success
```

### ❌ The "Fantasy Fill"
```javascript
// BAD: Creating fake data
const userData = fetchUser(); // returns null
const user = userData || { name: "Default" }; // masks problem
```

### ❌ The "Assumption Override"
```javascript
// BAD: Forcing forward
const result = parseData(input); // returns null
processResult(result || {}); // processes wrong thing
```

## State-Specific Application

### DISCOVER Mode
- Empty search results → Investigate search patterns
- Missing files → Verify path assumptions
- Null reads → Check file existence first

### OPTIMIZE Mode
- Failed edits → File might not exist
- Empty matches → Pattern might be wrong
- Null updates → Structure might differ

### UNLEASH Mode
- Failed writes → Directory might not exist
- Empty responses → API might have changed
- Null results → Dependencies might be missing

## Practical Reality-Check Examples

### Example 1: Unexpected API Response Structure
```
Expected: { user: { name, email, role } }
Actual: { data: { attributes: { full_name, email_address, permissions } } }

REALITY-CHECK RESPONSE:
"Response structure doesn't match expectations. Let me investigate:
1. Expected nested 'user' object, got 'data.attributes'
2. Expected 'name' field, got 'full_name'
3. Expected 'role' string, got 'permissions' array
4. Reality: API uses JSON:API specification format
5. Adjusting code to handle actual structure"
```

### Example 2: Wrong Data Type
```
Expected: Array of user IDs [1, 2, 3]
Actual: Comma-separated string "1,2,3"

REALITY-CHECK RESPONSE:
"Expected array but got string. Let me investigate:
1. Checking why data is string format
2. Reviewing API documentation... 
3. Reality: Legacy API returns CSV format for compatibility
4. Adjusting to parse string before processing"
```

### Example 3: Performance Expectation Mismatch
```
Expected: Query completes in < 100ms
Actual: Query takes 3000ms

REALITY-CHECK RESPONSE:
"Performance vastly different than expected. Let me investigate:
1. Expected fast local lookup
2. Actual: Makes network call to remote service
3. Checking implementation... includes external validation
4. Reality: This isn't a simple lookup, it's a validation service
5. Adjusting expectations and adding appropriate loading states"
```

## The Investigation Framework

### Level 1: Existence Check
```bash
- Does the file/directory exist?
- Is the service running?
- Is the connection active?
```

### Level 2: Permission Check
```bash
- Can I read this file?
- Am I authenticated?
- Do I have access rights?
```

### Level 3: Format Check
```bash
- Is the data in expected format?
- Is the structure what I assumed?
- Is the encoding correct?
```

### Level 4: Context Check
```bash
- Am I in the right directory?
- Is this the right environment?
- Are prerequisites met?
```

## The Reality Adjustment Matrix

| Expected vs Actual | Likely Reality | Required Adjustment |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Null when expecting data | Resource doesn't exist | Find correct location/name |
| Empty array when expecting results | Filter/query too restrictive | Adjust search parameters |
| Different data structure | API/format changed | Update to match actual schema |
| Wrong data type | Different encoding/format | Parse/transform appropriately |
| Missing properties | Incomplete data or wrong source | Find complete data source |
| Unexpected values | Different states/enums | Learn actual value meanings |
| Performance mismatch | Different implementation | Adjust expectations and UX |
| Wrong response format | Different protocol/standard | Adapt to actual protocol |

## Reality-Check Mantras

- "Expected vs actual reveals truth"
- "Reality doesn't match my model - adjust the model"
- "Every mismatch is a learning opportunity"
- "Build on what IS, not what SHOULD BE"
- "Question assumptions when expectations fail"

## The Cost of Ignoring Reality

```
Ignoring expectation mismatches leads to:
- Building on false assumptions (100% failure rate)
- Complex workarounds for "broken" systems (technical debt)
- Mysterious bugs hours later (10x debug time)
- Data corruption from wrong transformations (irreversible)
- User frustration from unexpected behavior (trust destruction)

Investigating expectation mismatches leads to:
- Accurate mental models (solid foundation)
- Clean code that matches reality (maintainable)
- Immediate problem solving (1x fix time)
- Robust solutions that handle actual data (reliable)
- Deep system understanding (compound learning)
```

## Canon Enforcement

### Violation Indicators
- Proceeding when expected ≠ actual without investigation
- Creating workarounds instead of understanding reality
- Forcing data to match expectations
- Suppressing or ignoring mismatches
- Building on unverified assumptions

### Enforcement Levels
1. **Warning**: "Expectation mismatch detected - investigation required"
2. **Blocking**: "Cannot proceed without understanding reality"
3. **Education**: "Review Reality-Check protocol"

## Success Metrics

You're following Reality-Check when:
- Every mismatch triggers investigation
- Assumptions are questioned and verified
- Mental models adjust to match reality
- Solutions handle actual data, not imagined structures
- Bugs from wrong assumptions approach zero

## The Reality Oath

*"I will not ignore mismatches between expected and actual. When reality differs from my expectations, I will listen to its message, adjust my understanding, and proceed with truth."*

## Final Commandment

**When expected ≠ actual, reality is the teacher and assumptions are the student.**

Every ignored mismatch becomes a future bug. Every investigated mismatch becomes deeper understanding. Choose wisdom.
